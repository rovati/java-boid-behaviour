# java-boid-behaviour
A small playground to explore behaviour of boids

### Current situation
Currently implements the 3 basics laws of boids behaviour in 2D and renders through JavaFX objects moving on a 2D plane following those rules.

### Planned
- improve UI to toggle the various laws and modify variables such as boids number
- improve behaviour around scene borders
- add other group behaviours such as queue forming, leader election, ...
